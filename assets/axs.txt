(Simple Script language for making new enemies, players, npc etc)

This would count on base 8 shi so like
XP = true (just if you want to make a player)
X8
X16
X32
X64
X128 (Those would all be for establishing both width and height in one line)
XPM = true (if you want player movement)
XPE = false (if you want AI movement)

example script:

XPX64

^^^ and that would establish an entire player
